Storable Technical Round 1: 
let arr = [0,1,1,0,2,2,1,1,2,2,0,0,0,1,2,0,1,1,2,0,1]
sort the array in O(n): Time complexity and O(1) space complexity without using any built in methods

Introduce your self
1. Focus on more problem solving with code writing as well
2. SetImmediate and Process. difference
3. While building the api, what are the key areas to focus
4. event loop (need to focus in depth: should write some code)
5. Redix database
6. What are the hooks you have used
7. expain Nodejs architecutre
